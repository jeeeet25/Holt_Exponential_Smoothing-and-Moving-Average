# Time Series Forecasting for Pre-Event Air RPM Series

This repository contains Python code for time series forecasting of the pre-event Air RPM (Revenue Passenger Miles) series using different smoothing methods.

## Overview

In this study, we analyze the pre-event Air RPM data and apply Moving Average, Simple Exponential Smoothing, and Holt Exponential Smoothing techniques for forecasting.

## Data

The data is provided in a CSV file with columns 'Month' and 'Air RPM (billions)' representing the time period and Air RPM in billions, respectively.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python and required libraries installed.
2. Replace the sample data in the code with your actual data.
3. Run the Python script to generate forecasts using different smoothing methods.

## Conclusion

After evaluating the results, we find that the Moving Average method with a window width of 2 provides the best fit for forecasting the pre-event Air RPM series.
